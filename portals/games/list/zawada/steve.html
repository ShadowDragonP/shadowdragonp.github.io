			<p>A "palindrome" is a word or number that is read the same way forwards or backwards.</p>
			<p>On a digital clock, "1:11" would be a palindrome, since "111" is also "111" backwards. Other examples would include "2:22", "3:33", "4:44", "5:55"... you get the idea.</p>
			<p>At what time would the clock display the next palindrome? Write your answer in letters.</p>
			<p>(Ex. 1:11 is "oneoneone," 2:22 is "twotwotwo")</p>
